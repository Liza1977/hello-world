# hello-world
Me... a Newbie...learning to code.....
Hello Devvies... no lies here.... I am a recruiter ( nooooo, stop running.....I don't bite..hard... for reals) who is learning to code. I am trying C# first as I believe it may be easier altho I'm really a Java gal. I am kinda failing forward here and any and all Indians on Youtube under "C# for beginners" videos have become my late night watching. I have 2 small kiddies (who I downloaded coding games for too teach them to code - and then I ended up playing it more than them.... move damn code car ..JUST.MOVE) and a husband #thestruggleisreal. I would really love to gain more knowledge within development. I LOVE IT recruitment and would like to add more value to developers when I speak to them ( of course that excludes ANYone on GIT as my motives are pure..... sort-off LOL ) I digress .... Basically at this stage I am like a 5 year old that just got on the bicycle... I can't even balance yet but here's for some scraped knees :-) 
I would appreciate any help from anyone with LOADS OF PATIENCE and a sense of humor - peace out !
